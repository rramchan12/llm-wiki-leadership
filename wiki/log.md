### Findings

#### 1. Contradictions

**1.1 Arbinger "No Techniques" vs. Listed Steps**
- Files: `wiki/books/arbinger-anatomy-of-peace.md` vs. `wiki/books/arbinger-self-deception.md`
- `arbinger-anatomy-of-peace.md` quotes: "There are no techniques for getting out of the box." Yet `arbinger-self-deception.md` provides four numbered steps for getting out of the box. `wiki/concepts/self-deception.md` also presents a numbered six-step sequence. The pages do not reconcile this tension.
- Recommendation: Add a clarifying note in `arbinger-self-deception.md` that these steps are orientations reflecting a shift of heart, not a checklist.

**1.2 Burns vs. Harris: Philosophical Root of Suffering**
- Files: `wiki/books/burns-feeling-good.md` vs. `wiki/books/harris-happiness-trap.md`
- Burns: "Depression is not an emotional problem at all. It's a thinking problem." Harris: struggling against negative emotions is itself the problem. ACT explicitly challenges the CBT assumption that fixing thinking fixes feelings. The wiki notes they are complementary but leaves the philosophical tension unresolved.
- Recommendation: Create a synthesis page "CBT vs. ACT: How to Choose" or add a reconciliation note to `wiki/concepts/cognitive-distortions.md`.

---

#### 2. Stale / Superseded Claims

**2.1 Feeling Good — 1980 Edition Only**
- File: `wiki/books/burns-feeling-good.md`
- The 1999 revised edition is what clinicians and researchers cite today. The page makes no mention of the 1999 revision; readers obtaining the 1980 original may find chapter structure mismatches.
- Recommendation: Update title line to note both editions (1980; revised 1999).

**2.2 Unsourced 7-Year Lifespan Claim**
- File: `wiki/concepts/peak-performance-aging.md`
- States "A shift in mindset toward aging can add ~7 years to lifespan" without attribution. This is from Becca Levy's 2002 research (not ingested).
- Recommendation: Attribute claim to Becca Levy or flag as unverified.

**2.3 Index Footer Count Discrepancy**
- Files: `wiki/log.md`, `wiki/index.md`
- Log records 46 pages cataloged + 1 added = 47. Manual count of index tables yields 45 (9 books + 21 concepts + 8 people + 7 situations). Footer is off by 2.
- Recommendation: Correct index footer to "Total pages: 45."

---

#### 3. Orphan Pages

**3.1 `wiki/situations/feeling-like-an-underachiever.md` — Near-Orphan**
- This situation page links outward to `[[managing-negative-thought-patterns]]`, `[[breaking-anxiety-cycles]]`, and `[[pursuing-impossible-goals]]` but NONE of those pages link back to it.
- `managing-negative-thought-patterns.md` Related situations: `[[breaking-anxiety-cycles]], [[facing-a-major-decision]]` — no link to feeling-like-an-underachiever
- `breaking-anxiety-cycles.md` Related situations: `[[managing-negative-thought-patterns]]` only
- `pursuing-impossible-goals.md` Related situations: `[[facing-a-major-decision]], [[breaking-anxiety-cycles]]` — no link to feeling-like-an-underachiever
- Additionally, concept pages that should list it in "Applied in" but don't: `cognitive-distortions`, `cognitive-defusion`, `habit-loops`, `self-deception`, `intrinsic-motivation`, `psychological-flexibility`, `values-based-action`.
- Recommendation: Add `[[feeling-like-an-underachiever]]` to "Related situations" in the three situation pages above, and to "Applied in" in the eight concept pages above.

---

#### 4. Missing Concept Pages

The following concepts are referenced via `[[wikilink]]` in multiple pages but have no concept page:

| Missing Concept | Referenced In | Inbound Link Count |
|---|---|---|
| `[[fear-management]]` | `flow-states.md`, `community-and-group-flow.md`, `kotler-gnar-country.md`, `gnar-country-mindset.md`, `incremental-progression.md`, `goal-setting.md` | 6 |
| `[[resilience]]` | `kotler-gnar-country.md`, `community-and-group-flow.md`, `stacked-practices.md`, `gnar-country-mindset.md`, `peak-performance-aging.md` | 5 |
| `[[ruthless-prioritization]]` | `kotler-gnar-country.md`, `goal-setting.md`, `values-based-action.md`, `stacked-practices.md`, `gnar-country-mindset.md` | 5 |
| `[[developmental-gateways]]` | `kotler-gnar-country.md`, `peak-performance-aging.md`, `gnar-country-mindset.md` | 3 |
| `[[fast-geometry]]` | `kotler-gnar-country.md`, `flow-states.md` | 2 |
| `[[RAIN]]` | `brewer-unwinding-anxiety.md` (key framework, no concept page created) | 1 |

Additional concepts mentioned in prose but never formally paged:
- Growth mindset (Dweck) — cited in `kotler-art-of-impossible.md` as prerequisite for peak performance
- Massively Transformative Purpose (MTP) — heavily used in `kotler-art-of-impossible.md` and `intrinsic-motivation.md`
- Ooching — described in `wrap-framework.md` and `heath-decisive.md` as a distinct technique

High-priority (5+ broken links): `fear-management`, `resilience`, `ruthless-prioritization`.

---

#### 5. Missing Cross-References

**5.1 `wiki/situations/facing-a-major-decision.md` — No Connections Section**
- Every other situation page has a "Connections" block. This page ends with "Sources & Related Pages" only — no links to related situations.
- Missing: `[[starting-a-new-leadership-role]]`, `[[pursuing-impossible-goals]]`, `[[navigating-interpersonal-conflict]]`.

**5.2 `wiki/books/kotler-gnar-country.md` — Sparse Connections Section**
- Connections section only has: "Supports: [[peak-performance-aging]], [[flow-states]], [[resilience]], [[goal-setting]] — See also: [[steven-kotler]]"
- Missing: `[[community-and-group-flow]]`, `[[incremental-progression]]`, `[[stacked-practices]]`, `[[gnar-country-mindset]]`, `[[intrinsic-motivation]]`, `[[pursuing-impossible-goals]]`.

**5.3 `wiki/concepts/self-deception.md` — Narrow "Applied in"**
- "Applied in: `[[navigating-interpersonal-conflict]]`" only.
- Missing: `[[starting-a-new-leadership-role]]`, `[[feeling-like-an-underachiever]]`.

**5.4 `wiki/concepts/values-based-action.md` — Missing Situation Links**
- "Applied in: `[[managing-negative-thought-patterns]], [[pursuing-impossible-goals]]`"
- Missing: `[[breaking-anxiety-cycles]]` (Step 4), `[[feeling-like-an-underachiever]]` (Step 5).

**5.5 `wiki/concepts/intrinsic-motivation.md` — Missing Inbound Situation Link**
- "Applied in: `[[pursuing-impossible-goals]]`" only.
- Missing: `[[feeling-like-an-underachiever]]`.

#### 6. Frontmatter Issues

| File | Issue |
|---|---|
| `concepts/psychological-flexibility.md` | `sources` field missing `arbinger-self-deception` and `burns-feeling-good` — both discussed substantively in body |
| `concepts/values-based-action.md` | `sources` field missing `heath-decisive` and `arbinger-anatomy-of-peace` — both in "How Books Treat This" table |
| `concepts/intrinsic-motivation.md` | `sources` field missing `brewer-unwinding-anxiety` — appears in "How Books Treat This" table |
| `situations/pursuing-impossible-goals.md` | `sources` field missing `brewer-unwinding-anxiety` — used in Backing Evidence table |
| `situations/navigating-interpersonal-conflict.md` | `sources` field missing `burns-feeling-good` — used in Backing Evidence table |
| `wiki/index.md` | Footer "Total pages: 47" does not match manual count of 45 cataloged entries (9+21+8+7). Off by 2. |

All other pages pass frontmatter validation (title, category, tags, sources, created, updated present and non-empty).

---

#### 7. Index Gaps

No pages are missing from the index — all 45 audited files correspond to index entries. The sole issue is the footer count discrepancy (47 stated vs. 45 actual).

---

#### 8. Gaps / Suggested Reading

| Gap | Why It Matters | Suggested Source |
|---|---|---|
| Change management | `dan-heath.md` and `chip-heath.md` reference *Switch* (Rider/Elephant/Path) as directly relevant; no book or concept page | *Switch* — Chip & Dan Heath |
| Deliberate practice | Referenced in Kotler pages (Ericsson) as learning mechanism; no concept page | *Peak* — Anders Ericsson |
| Growth mindset | Cited in `kotler-art-of-impossible.md` as prerequisite; no page | *Mindset* — Carol Dweck |
| Psychological safety | Directly relevant to `community-and-group-flow.md` and `outward-mindset.md`; not represented | *The Fearless Organization* — Amy Edmondson |
| Systems thinking / upstream | Dan Heath's *Upstream* mentioned in `dan-heath.md` but no book page | *Upstream* — Dan Heath |
| Feedback and coaching | Watkins addresses team assessment; no concept page on giving/receiving feedback | *Thanks for the Feedback* — Stone & Heen |
| Organizational culture | Watkins repeatedly cites culture as constraint; no concept or book page | *Organizational Culture and Leadership* — Schein |
| Emotional intelligence | Runs through Arbinger and Watkins themes but not represented | *Emotional Intelligence* — Goleman |
| Stoicism | Values-based action, acceptance of discomfort connect directly to Harris and Kotler | *Meditations* — Marcus Aurelius |

## [2026-04-25] lint | Wiki health-check + structural fixes

**Findings:**
- README stale: listed 9 books, wiki has 18 → fixed
- `wiki/index.md`: all `[[slug]]` links used Obsidian wiki-link syntax, not standard Markdown → converted to relative links with human-readable display names
- Redundancy: `sudden-low-mood.md` Layers 2 & 3 copied CBT step sequence + full distortion table + defusion steps verbatim from `managing-negative-thought-patterns.md` → compressed to summaries with cross-references
- `sudden-low-mood` missing from Connections of `breaking-anxiety-cycles` and `managing-negative-thought-patterns` → fixed
- No contradictions found between pages
- No orphan pages
- **Gaps flagged (not fixed — need new books or queries):**
  - Synthesis section has only 1 page; could expand to: mood regulation across books, peak performance stack comparison
  - No situation pages yet for: giving radically candid feedback, designing defining moments, enabling flow on a team, switching entrenched behavior at scale

**Updated:**
- `wiki/index.md` (all table links)
- `wiki/situations/sudden-low-mood.md` (Layers 2 & 3 tightened)
- `wiki/situations/breaking-anxiety-cycles.md` (added cross-link to sudden-low-mood)
- `wiki/situations/managing-negative-thought-patterns.md` (added cross-link to sudden-low-mood)
- `README.md` (book count 9 → 18, updated categorized library)

Synthesis (1):
- `wiki/synthesis/explicit-principles-as-leadership-os.md` — Amazon PR-FAQ + SEAL extreme ownership + Bridgewater radical transparency all share the same architectural pattern: explicit principles → enforcement mechanisms → visible reasoning → leader modeling at cost.

Tracker (1):
- `wiki/books/_batch3-pending-updates.md` — lists ~20 extensions to EXISTING concept pages (flow-states, resilience, goal-setting, sticky-communication, values-based-action, premortem, ruthless-prioritization, fear-management, incremental-progression) NOT YET APPLIED to the actual files.

**Updated (2 files):**
- `wiki/people/chip-heath.md` — sources frontmatter and books table extended with Making Numbers Count
- `wiki/index.md` — all sections updated (Books +7, Concepts +11, People +9, Situations +7, Synthesis +1); total pages 74 → 110

**Source:** LLM knowledge (no raw/ files provided for this batch)

**Known deferred work:**
- Extensions in `_batch3-pending-updates.md` must still be applied to the existing concept pages listed there.
- `[VERIFY]` markers in `heath-making-numbers-count.md` should be confirmed against the actual book text.

- Pages touched: 39 created + 2 updated = 41
- Status: complete (index + log finalized; concept extensions deferred to next session)
